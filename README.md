# Page success widget test processing experiment

This is an experiment, trying to use basic Natural Language Processing algorithms in Python to try to get insights from open text feedback on Canada.ca.


## Current techniques used

- bag of words (most frequent terms)
- n-grams
- TF-IDF to compare meaningful words based on topic tagged

## Planned techniques

- classification to autotag feedback
- clustering (to try to group feedback automatically)
